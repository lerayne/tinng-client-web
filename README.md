Web client for tinng service

##Development

Dont forget to do ``bower update`` (bower dependencies do not stored in repo!)

Run ``compact.sh`` to get the minimized production version of the program. It compiles index-source.html to vulcanized 
and minified index.html and just vulcanized index-dev.html
