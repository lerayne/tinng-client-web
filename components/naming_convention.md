**basic** - non-UI modules, or other entities, such as behaviors
**block** - minor UI component such as tag or user avatar
**card** - content module, represented as material design's "card" metaphor, such as message
**page** - a complete page of an app, in other words - app's "mode". I.e. basic messaging, settings, etc
**text** - inline element component, i.e. used for translation
**unit** - self-succicient content module, i.e. topic, messages, tags or users
